  <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by the Cabinet Office, working with:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government</li>
    <li>the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs</li>
    <li>the Department for Work & Pensions</li>
    <li>the National Health Service (NHS)</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">We’ll use the personal information you provide through this service to help make sure that people with a medical condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to coronavirus get the support they need.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We’ll use it to check your needs against data provided to us by the NHS, and to contact you with further advice or information.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We’ll also use it to get in touch with you so we can get your feedback on the service and support you have received.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This privacy notice covers:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the online service, where you can enter the information that we need to get support to you where you live</li>
    <li>the automated telephone service, where you can provide the same information over the phone</li>
    <li>online surveys and other tools we may use to get your feedback on the service</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Lawful basis for processing your personal information</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are processing this information on the basis that we’re carrying out a task in the public interest and to protect the vital interests of people more vulnerable to coronavirus.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This lawful basis applies to:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>information shared with us by the NHS</li>
  <li> provided to us through the online service or the automated telephone service</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Some of the information we hold is sensitive health and care information. This is classed as ‘special category’ personal data within the meaning of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 2018, meaning we must state a further lawful basis for processing it. We’re also relying on substantial public interest and governmental purpose to process this information.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">If you provide any information through the surveys or other tools we may use to get your feedback, we’ll process this information on the basis that we’re carrying out a task in the public interest.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your information</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">When you submit information through the online service or the automated telephone service, we will compare your information to information shared with us by the NHS.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We ask for information about you and those who are supporting you through the online service and the automated telephone service. We may ask for more information as part of your subsequent interactions with the service. We may also ask for your feedback on the service.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We’ll share relevant parts of your information with other government departments, NHS bodies, local authorities and other public sector and private sector organisations - depending on what’s necessary to get people the support they need.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information with other public sector bodies in order to make sure that we and they have accurate data on who is vulnerable to coronavirus and to make sure we get help to the people who need it.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information (except for confidential health and care information) with trusted supermarkets and other suppliers, so they can prioritise your orders if you have indicated that you need help getting basic supplies. When we do so, we make sure we only provide the minimum information that is required to get help to you as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">We may use your data to produce anonymised information and share this information with other government departments to improve services, understand changing patterns of support needs or identify new support needs. The data we share for this purpose won’t identify you personally.</p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your information</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">We will only keep your personal information for as long as we need it:</p>

    <li>to make sure this service is meeting overall demand from vulnerable people</li>
    <li>to help with the overall government response to coronavirus</li>
