#What happens next

{% if wants_supermarket_deliveries and wants_social_care %}

You should be able to start booking priority supermarket deliveries in the next 1 to 7 days, depending on the supermarket.

If you do not already have an account with a supermarket delivery service, set one up now. You can set up accounts with more than one supermarket if you're worried about not getting a delivery slot.

Someone from your local authority will contact you about your care needs within the next week.
